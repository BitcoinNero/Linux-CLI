## Run Daemon or Simple Wallet
```
To open the wallet you will probably need to open the permissions:
-Click right on Daemon
-Properties
-Permissions
-Allow executing file as program
-Make the same for Wallet

To create a wallet:
-Launch the WALLET application
-Press G to generate a wallet (O to open)
-Set a name for the wallet and a password

The application will generate two files one containing your access keys encrypted "NAME.wallet" 
and a second with your public address, it is this one that will allow you to receive Bitcoin Nero.

To make transactions and more open the Daemon application, wait for the end of the sync and then click HELP to know the functionality.
```
